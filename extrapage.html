                    least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing
                    an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had
                    stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke
                    in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but
                    thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a
                    man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went
                    up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,
                    scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the
                    sofa.

                <div class="actr">"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's
                    mind at rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the
                    politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even
                    irony could be discerned.

                    must put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is
                    coming for me to take me there."

                <div>"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these

                    have been put off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by
                    force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.
